Inverse kinematics module
=========================
Computes forward and inverse kinematics of robotic arms including Debra's arms.

### Demo
A visual demo using pygame gets the position of your cursor, sets it as tool position and allows you to see the arm reconstructed through inverse kinematics.
To run it, you need to install pygame (see http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu), then run:
```sh
python3 scara_visualiser.py
```
